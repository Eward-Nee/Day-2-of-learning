            You see, this is nhe nice thing
            about a external css method: we
            can apply the same styling code
            of diff html forms if we just 
            use their id's or their class 
            names.
        </pre>

        <pre id="par">
        so what I am saying is that we don't 
        need to go write new css styling code 
        for every thing we want to style when 
        working with the external css method.
        We must only make sure that the html 
        tags is identifieble and that the html 
        file is connected to the css file.
